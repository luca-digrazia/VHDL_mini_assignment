# mini_assignment

The mini-assignment has to be handed in for evaluation before the oral exam and no later than the
end of February exam session. It will count 2/30 bonus on the final mark.
It consists in:
• Creating an IPCore using ISE LogicCORE tool.
• Creating a Top Level Wrapper to include such CORE.
• Writing a proper Testbench to ‘verify’ that the CORE works correctly.
• Providing a readable WAVEFORMS Configuration.
